A blocks powered WordPress theme for bands, musicians, or DJs, based on the C9 Starter theme from [COVERT NINE](https://www.covertnine.com).

== Description ==

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there source code for this theme? =

Yes, you can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/covertnine/c9-starter).

= Does this theme support Gutenberg blocks? =

Yes! Use the C9 Blocks plugin, which you are prompted to install after theme activation, which works seamlessly with the new Gutenberg editor for WordPress.

= Is there sub-menu levels of drop downs in the top navigation? =

If you use the default navigation, then only one level of drop down is supported, but if you activate the Max Mega Menu plugin, it supports multiple tiers of drop downs and mega menus with widgets and multiple lists of links.
