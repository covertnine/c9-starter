C9 Togo is a theme made for restaurants, catering companies, breweries, or any food and beverage concept that wants to offer online ordering, local pickup and delivery through their WordPress website. Fully compatible with WordPress 5.5--based on the [C9 Starter](https://c9.covertnine.com) theme that uses Bootstrap and [C9 Blocks](https://c9.covertnine.com).

== Description ==
A restaurant ordering and delivery theme for WordPress 5.5 that makes it easy to add online ordering for any food and beverage concept with local pickup/delivery options instead of just shipping.
