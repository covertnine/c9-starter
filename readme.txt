A block-driven WordPress theme for businesses based on the C9 starter theme from [COVERT NINE](https://www.covertnine.com).

== Description ==
The C9 Work theme was made for building out complex responsive landing pages with ease for marketing campaigns, media, content, and articles in WordPress with the help of the [C9 Blocks](https://wordpress.org/plugins/c9-blocks) plugin. The C9 Work theme supports the use of Max Mega Menu and Woocommerce for online sales or catalogs. Build landing pages with blocks from scratch, or use the C9 Blocks landing page templates to build an entire site in minutes instead of hours. This theme makes use of custom pagination instead of the_posts_pagination.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I install sample content, and setup the theme with a fresh WordPress install? =

Glad you asked, the sample content and C9 Work theme install guide can be found at [here](https://work.covertnine.com/setup).

= Does this theme support Gutenberg? =

Yes! Use the [C9 Blocks](https://c9.covertnine.com) plugin, which you are prompted to install after theme activation, which works seamlessly with the new Gutenberg editor for WordPress.

= How do we set up the Max Mega Menu? =

The C9 Work theme includes the theme styling for the mega menu with it. After installing and activating plugins, you can make changes to the styling from the Max Mega Menu settings page. To learn more about building Mega Menus head over to the [Max Mega Menu Documentation](https://www.megamenu.com/documentation/theme-editor/).

= Is there sub-menu levels of drop downs in the top navigation? =

If you use the default navigation, then only one level of drop down is supported, but if you activate the mega menu plugin, it supports multiple tiers of drop downs and mega menus with widgets and multiple lists of links.
